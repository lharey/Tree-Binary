0.05  Tue Oct 12 12:00:00 2004
	- fixed issue with the clone method where it
		did not properly fix the parentel relations
	- added tests and docs for this
	- improved clone and cloneShallow with the addition

		clone the nodes
	- added test and docs for this

0.04  Tue Aug 31 12:00:00 2004
	- fixed memory leak in Tree::Binary, this is
		related to a bug found in Tree::Simple. The
		code is similar so I knew the issue would be
		in here too. I also added a DESTROY method
		to Tree::Binary::Search to force cleanup of
		the underlying Tree::Binary object.
	- added a test to check that the leak is
		fixed. It requires Test::Memory::Cycle
		to be run (14_Tree_Binary_leak_test.t)
	- added documentation (copied from Tree::Simple)
		relating to the use of the DESTROY method

0.03  Wed Aug 25 12:00:00 2004
	- added test with Theorems idea in the file
		(50_Tree_Binary_Theorem_Proofs_test.t)
	- Tree::Binary
	- added the 'size' and 'height' methods
	- added tests for these
	- added documentation for these
	- Tree::Binary::Search -
	- added the 'accept', 'size' and 'height' methods
		which really just delegate to the underlying
		Tree::Binary object.
	- added tests for these
	- added documentation for these

0.02  Tue Aug 24 12:00:00 2004
    - beefed up the test suite a lot
	- Tree::Binary
	- Added the 'mirror' method

	- added tests for that
	- Tree::Binary::Search
	- fixed up some edge cases on the 'delete' method
	- added tests for these
