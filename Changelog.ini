Comments= <<EOT
- fixed memory leak in Tree::Binary, this is
related to a bug found in Tree::Simple. The
code is similar so I knew the issue would be
in here too. I also added a DESTROY method
to Tree::Binary::Search to force cleanup of
the underlying Tree::Binary object.
- added a test to check that the leak is
fixed. It requires Test::Memory::Cycle
to be run (14_Tree_Binary_leak_test.t)
- added documentation (copied from Tree::Simple)
relating to the use of the DESTROY method
